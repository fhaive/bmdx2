# Set mode

BMDx is implemented to work in a dual mode: GLP (Good Laboratory Practice) and non-GLP mode. If GLP mode is selected by the user, all the steps of the analysis will be recorded in a log file.
Furthermore, at every step of the analysis the user will be prompted to add information about the analysis. 
First, the user will be asked to give a description about the aims of the analysis. 
Next, for every step that the user perform, an explanation for performing the step and the selected values for the parameters will be requested.
